# Elevator-VHDL

University project. Elevator in VHDL.

VHDL files can be found in "CodeFiles" directory, the rest of the files and pictures are for a Latex document with an explanation of the work done (in Spanish).


Theres different tags:
+ V0.1 - Theorical version, tested in computer (code and testbench)
+ V1.1 - Implemented version, tested in FPGA
+ V1.2 - Imp. V: new functionalities added: now the elevator can "remember" two floors to go after it has reached the actual one. It goes to them in the same order they are stored.
